# SQL Resources

[Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is how we tell databases what shape we want to see our data in. It's a _declarative_ language, which roughly means it describes the final output and doesn't care about the procedures or implementation of how to produce it.

SQL is a [common language][1], but there are differences between databases. One of the goals of Arel is to abstract over those differences so, for instance, MySQL and Postgres users can write the same code regardless of database. Of course different databases have different capabilities and levels of adherence to the SQL spec.
